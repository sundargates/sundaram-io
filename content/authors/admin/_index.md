I am an infrastructure engineer with great passion for performance and scalability. 
Most recently I have been working on a highly scalable, low-latency stateful task execution system that handles Uber's CI workloads. 
Before that, I researched extensively on techniques to guarantee ACID like properties for large monorepos and built a system utilized by 5k+ developers at Uber.
