Hello there! ðŸ˜Š

My name is Sundaram, and I'm a software developer with a deep passion for building distributed systems and exploring their applications across various domains. 
Currently, I'm thrilled to be working at Netflix, where I get to tinker with stream processing engines.

I've been on this incredible journey as a Software Developer for over 10 wonderful years now.
I've had the privilege of working with some [amazing teams][work-url] and building some [really cool stuff][morning-paper] along the way.

If you're curious to learn more about my work or explore potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out. 
I'd love to hear from you!

Warm regards,  
Sundaram ðŸŒŸ
